# CTO-SKILLS

A skill repository for a "Technical Co-Founder" workflow, designed to help turn product ideas into real, launch-ready software.

## Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/NeverSight/CTO-SKILLS --skill technical-cofounder
```

## Design Principles

- Real product focus: not a mockup, not just a prototype
- Product-owner-in-the-loop: pause at key decision points
- Plain-language communication: translate technical details clearly
- Scope discipline: ship a focused v1 before expanding
