# CTO-SKILLS

A skill repository for a "Technical Co-Founder" workflow, designed to help turn product ideas into real, launch-ready software.

If your environment prefers the non-`.git` URL, this also works:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/NeverSight/CTO-SKILLS --skill technical-cofounder
```
